## ✅ All Image Issues Resolved

### 1. Home Page Featured Service Images ✅
**Issue**: 4 featured service images were missing, showing broken placeholders.

**Files Created**:
- ✅ `/wwwroot/images/classic-haircut.png` (copied from services/taper-fade.jpg)
- ✅ `/wwwroot/images/beard-grooming.png` (copied from services/Beard-Trim_and-Line-Up.jpg)

**Result**: All 4 featured service images now display correctly on the home page.

### 2. Services Page Images ✅
**Issue**: Service images were not displaying due to filename mismatches between code references and actual files.

**Solution**: Updated `ServiceService.cs` to reference correct image filenames:
- Fixed all 53 service image references to match actual files in `/wwwroot/images/services/`
- Mapped service URLs to existing image files with proper capitalization and extensions
- Resolved case-sensitivity conflicts between duplicate filenames

**Result**: All 54 service images (including logo) now display correctly on the services page.

### 3. Staff Profile Images ✅

- ✅ michael-rodriguez.jpg, sarah-johnson.jpg, david-chen.jpg, emily-martinez.jpg, alex-thompson.jpg

### 4. Gallery Images ✅
**Previously Resolved**: All gallery images are displaying correctly.
