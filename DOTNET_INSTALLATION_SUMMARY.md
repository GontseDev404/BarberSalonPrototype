## Next Steps

1. **Access the Application**: The barber salon application is now running at http://localhost:5000
2. **Test Image Fixes**: All previously broken images should now display correctly:
   - Staff profile pictures
   - Home page service images
   - Gallery images

## Environment Configuration

The .NET PATH has been permanently added to your shell profile:
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/home/ubuntu/.dotnet"
```

This ensures .NET commands will be available in future terminal sessions.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Restart your terminal to ensure PATH changes are loaded
- Run `dotnet --info` to verify installation
- Check that all image files exist in wwwroot/images/
- Use `dotnet clean && dotnet build` to rebuild from scratch
